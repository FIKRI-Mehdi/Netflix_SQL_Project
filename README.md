üìä Netflix Data Analysis with SQL
Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's Movies and TV Shows dataset using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer key business questions that provide a deeper understanding of Netflix's content offerings.

üîç Problem
Netflix offers a wide range of content globally, making it challenging to understand its composition, trends, and audience targeting. Business stakeholders need insights such as:

What type of content dominates the platform?

Which ratings are most frequent?

Which countries and genres are leading in production?

What trends can we spot over the past years?

üí° Solution
To address these questions, we used a structured SQL-based approach on the Kaggle Netflix dataset.
